## Overview

This highly-cited research (481 citations) examines the adoption factors of IoT smart home services through an integrated theoretical framework combining multiple adoption models.

## Research Framework

We developed a comprehensive model integrating:
- **VAM** (Value-based Adoption Model)
- **TAM** (Technology Acceptance Model)
- **UTAUT** (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology)
- **ELM** (Elaboration Likelihood Model)

## Methodology

- **Sample**: Smart home service users and potential adopters
- **Analysis**: Structural equation modeling (SEM)
- **Variables**: Perceived usefulness, ease of use, perceived value, social influence, facilitating conditions

## Key Findings

### Value Perception Factors
- **Perceived Usefulness**: Strong positive effect on adoption intention
- **Perceived Ease of Use**: Significant mediating role
- **Perceived Value**: Critical determinant of adoption decision

### Social and Contextual Factors
- **Social Influence**: Moderate effect on adoption intention
- **Facilitating Conditions**: Enable actual usage behavior
- **Trust**: Essential foundation for smart home adoption

## Theoretical Contributions

1. Integration of multiple adoption theories for comprehensive understanding
2. Identification of unique characteristics of IoT smart home services
3. Validation of value-based approach in IoT context

## Practical Implications

- Service providers should focus on demonstrating tangible value
- Ease of installation and use are critical for market penetration
- Building trust through security and privacy protection is essential

## Impact

With 481 citations, this paper has become a foundational reference in IoT and smart home adoption research, widely cited in technology acceptance and innovation diffusion studies.
