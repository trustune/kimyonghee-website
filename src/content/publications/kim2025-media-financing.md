## Research Background

Korea's media ecosystem faces a structural financing crisis that threatens the sustainability of public service broadcasting and quality content production. The crisis stems from the convergence of multiple adverse trends: a 44-year freeze on public broadcasting license fees that has eroded real funding by 82 percent, a 43.5 percent collapse in broadcast advertising revenue over the past decade as spending migrated to digital platforms, and growing platform contribution gaps as IPTV and OTT services expand without commensurate financial contribution to the content ecosystem.

These financing pressures have materialized gradually but now demand urgent policy attention. Public broadcasters face constrained budgets that limit their ability to produce the high-quality news, cultural, and educational programming that constitutes their public service mandate. Commercial broadcasters struggle to maintain content investment as advertising revenues decline. Meanwhile, global streaming platforms that consume substantial audience attention and increasingly commission Korean content operate outside the regulatory and financial frameworks that govern domestic broadcasters.

This work-in-progress analyzes the structural dimensions of the media financing crisis and proposes a comprehensive policy framework for restoring ecosystem sustainability. Drawing on international benchmarking and stakeholder analysis, the research develops a phased reform roadmap addressing license fee normalization, advertising regulation adjustment, and platform contribution requirements.

## The License Fee Crisis

Korea's public broadcasting license fee has remained frozen at 2,500 won per month since 1981, representing one of the longest periods of fee stagnation among developed democracies with public broadcasting systems. When adjusted for inflation, the real value of the license fee has declined by approximately 82 percent over this 44-year period. This erosion has progressively constrained public broadcasters' financial capacity while their programming and infrastructure costs have increased substantially.

International comparison reveals the anomaly of Korea's situation. OECD countries with significant public broadcasting systems have typically implemented regular fee adjustments to maintain real funding levels. Germany's license fee undergoes quadrennial review by an independent commission. The United Kingdom's BBC license fee, while politically contested, has received periodic adjustments. Japan's NHK receives fee levels substantially above Korea's in both absolute and per-capita terms. Korea's prolonged fee freeze places its public broadcasters at a significant disadvantage relative to international peers.

The political economy of license fee adjustment presents formidable challenges. Fee increases require legislative action and face public resistance given their visibility as household charges. Previous reform attempts have encountered opposition from both politicians wary of voter backlash and advocacy groups critical of public broadcaster performance. Breaking this political deadlock requires reframing the issue as ecosystem sustainability rather than public broadcaster funding alone.

## The Advertising Revenue Collapse

Broadcast advertising revenue in Korea has declined by 43.5 percent over the decade from 2015 to 2024, representing a structural shift rather than cyclical fluctuation. This collapse reflects the migration of advertising spending from traditional broadcasting to digital platforms, particularly search and social media advertising that offer superior targeting and measurement capabilities. The trend shows no signs of reversal and is projected to continue as digital advertising technology advances.

The advertising decline has differential impacts across broadcaster types. Commercial broadcasters dependent on advertising revenue face existential pressure, with some regional stations operating at loss. Public broadcasters that rely on advertising to supplement license fee income—unlike the BBC model of license-fee-only funding—face budget compression from both revenue sources simultaneously. The competitive dynamics of advertising markets mean that revenue shortfalls cannot be recovered through rate increases; reduced budgets translate directly into reduced content investment.

Content quality erosion represents the most concerning consequence of advertising decline. Broadcasters respond to revenue pressure by reducing production budgets, limiting original programming, and increasing reliance on lower-cost formats. This degradation undermines the competitive position of Korean content domestically while potentially affecting the international reputation built through recent cultural exports. Breaking the cycle of revenue decline and quality erosion requires fundamental restructuring of media financing.

## Platform Contribution Gaps

The rapid growth of IPTV services and over-the-top streaming platforms has restructured Korean media consumption without corresponding adjustment to the financial relationships that support content production. IPTV operators have expanded substantially while their contributions to the broadcasting ecosystem—through retransmission fees, must-carry obligations, and public interest programming requirements—have not kept pace with their market presence.

OTT platforms present an even more significant policy challenge. Global streaming services such as Netflix and Disney+ now reach millions of Korean households and have become major commissioners of Korean content. However, they operate largely outside the regulatory and financial frameworks that govern domestic broadcasters. They pay no license fees, face limited local content requirements, and make no direct contribution to public service broadcasting. As their market share grows, the financial sustainability of the ecosystem they draw upon becomes increasingly precarious.

Addressing platform contribution gaps requires balancing multiple objectives: maintaining Korea's attractiveness as a content production location, ensuring fair competition between domestic and global platforms, and generating sustainable funding for public service content. Heavy-handed regulation risks driving production activity offshore, while insufficient action allows continued free-riding on ecosystem resources.

## Proposed Policy Framework

The research proposes a three-phase reform approach spanning from 2025 to 2029 and beyond. The first phase, covering 2025 to 2026, focuses on emergency stabilization through immediate license fee adjustment to a minimum sustainable level, temporary relief from advertising regulations that constrain broadcaster competitiveness, and establishment of baseline platform contribution requirements.

The second phase, from 2027 to 2028, implements structural reform through comprehensive redesign of the media financing model. This includes multi-source funding diversification that reduces dependence on any single revenue stream, adoption of international best practices in license fee governance including independent review mechanisms, and technology-neutral regulatory frameworks that apply comparable obligations to comparable services regardless of delivery technology.

The third phase, beginning in 2029, establishes long-term sustainability mechanisms including automatic fee adjustment indexed to inflation or broadcasting costs, comprehensive platform contribution requirements calibrated to market presence, and performance-based funding allocation that links public support to public service delivery.

## Current Status

The research is at the data analysis and policy design stage. Time-series analysis of revenue structures has been completed, and international benchmarking has identified relevant policy models. Stakeholder impact assessment is underway to understand how proposed reforms would affect different ecosystem participants. Policy simulation modeling will project outcomes under alternative reform scenarios.

The work targets completion in the second quarter of 2025 with planned submission to a media policy journal. The research complements the Broadcasting Revenue Structure Analysis (2015-2024) conference paper by providing deeper policy analysis and reform recommendations.
