## Research Overview

This work-in-progress examines the financing crisis facing Korea's media ecosystem, proposing structural reforms to ensure long-term sustainability of public service broadcasting and media content production.

## Key Issues Identified

### 1. License Fee Freeze Crisis
- **Duration**: 44 years without adjustment (since 1981)

- **Real Value Loss**: 82% decline when adjusted for inflation
- **International Comparison**: Significantly below OECD standards

### 2. Advertising Revenue Collapse
- **10-Year Decline**: 43.5% reduction (2015-2024)
- **Market Shift**: Migration to digital platforms
- **Impact**: Reduced content production budgets
- **Future Outlook**: Continued structural decline

### 3. Platform Contribution Gap
- **IPTV Growth**: Rapid expansion with limited contribution
- **OTT Platforms**: Minimal financial contribution to ecosystem
