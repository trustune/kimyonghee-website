abstract: "This study analyzes the structural crisis in Korea's media industry financing and the unintended consequences of broadcasting reapproval investment requirements. Using panel fixed effects regression on 10 years of financial data (2015-2024) from major cable networks, we document a significant crowding-out effect: government broadcasting development fund contributions of KRW 43.1 billion are associated with investment reductions of KRW 73.3-164 billion, representing a 1.7-3.8 times crowding-out multiplier. Investment ratio requirements reduce ROI significantly, while the 44-year freeze on public broadcasting license fees and 43.5% collapse in broadcast advertising revenue compound the financing crisis. We propose a comprehensive reform roadmap including abolition of rigid investment mandates, revenue-linked alternatives, and license fee normalization."

## Research Overview

This study examines the financing crisis facing Korea's media ecosystem through two interconnected lenses: (1) the unintended consequences of broadcasting reapproval investment requirements on cable network performance, and (2) the broader structural crisis of media industry financing. Using panel data from major broadcasting companies (2015-2024), we provide empirical evidence that well-intentioned regulatory mandates can produce counterproductive outcomes.

## Key Findings

### 1. Crowding-Out Effect of Investment Mandates

Panel fixed effects analysis of four major cable networks (JTBC, TV Chosun, MBN, Channel A) reveals:

| Effect | Estimate | Significance |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Investment ratio requirement on ROI | -1.018 | p < 0.001 |
| Investment increase on operating margin | -0.60%p | p < 0.001 |
| Government fund on investment | Not significant | p = 0.614 |

- Government broadcasting development fund contributions: KRW 43.1 billion
- Associated investment reduction: KRW 73.3-164 billion
- **Crowding-out multiplier**: 1.7-3.8 times

### 2. Three Structural Problems Identified

#### Rigid Regulations in a Rapidly Changing Market
- 5-year investment plans mandated in an unpredictable market environment
- Broadcasting market conditions change faster than regulatory review cycles
- Investment requirements set at reapproval become outdated within the compliance period

#### Crowding-Out of Productive Investment
- Mandatory investment requirements redirect resources from commercially viable projects
- Fund contributions reduce net available investment capital
- Higher investment ratios are associated with lower profitability

#### Regulatory Persistence After Goal Achievement
- Original investment promotion goals have been achieved over 15 years of compliance
- Cable networks have established stable investment patterns
- Continued mandates serve administrative rather than market-corrective functions

### 3. Broader Media Financing Crisis

#### License Fee Freeze
- **Duration**: 44 years without adjustment (since 1981)
- **Current Fee**: KRW 2,500 per month
- **Real Value Loss**: 82% decline when adjusted for inflation
- **International Gap**: Significantly below OECD standards

#### Advertising Revenue Collapse
- **10-Year Decline**: 43.5% reduction in broadcast advertising (2015-2024)
- **Structural Cause**: Irreversible migration to digital platforms
- **Impact**: Severely reduced content production budgets

#### Platform Contribution Gap
- IPTV rapid expansion with limited ecosystem contribution
- OTT platforms generating minimal financial contribution
- Uneven burden distribution between legacy broadcasters and new platforms

## Data and Methodology

### Data Sources
- Broadcasting company financial statements (2015-2024)
- Korea Communications Commission regulatory reports
- Broadcasting development fund contribution records
- OECD media policy database

### Empirical Strategy
- **Panel fixed effects regression** with cluster-robust standard errors
- **Analysis subjects**: 4 major general programming cable networks
- **Period**: 10 years (2015-2024)
- **Key variables**: Investment ratio, operating margin, ROI, fund contributions, revenue

## Policy Proposals

### Priority 1: Abolition of Rigid Investment Mandates
- Remove fixed investment ratio requirements from reapproval conditions
- Allow market-driven investment allocation
- Reduce regulatory compliance burden

### Priority 2: Revenue-Linked Alternatives
- Replace fixed targets with revenue-proportional benchmarks
- Introduce automatic adjustment mechanisms tied to market conditions
- Implement total amount management instead of ratio requirements

### Priority 3: License Fee Normalization
- Adjust public broadcasting license fees to sustainable levels
- Introduce inflation-indexed automatic adjustment mechanism
- Benchmark against OECD peers

### Priority 4: System-wide Reform
- Extend reapproval validity from 5 to 7 years
- Develop technology-neutral regulatory framework
- Establish platform contribution baseline

## Phased Reform Roadmap

### Phase 1: Emergency Stabilization (2025-2026)
- License fee adjustment to minimum sustainable level
- Temporary advertising regulation relief
- Platform contribution baseline establishment

### Phase 2: Structural Reform (2027-2028)
- Comprehensive financing model redesign
- Multi-source funding diversification
- International best practice adoption

### Phase 3: Long-term Sustainability (2029+)
- Automatic adjustment mechanisms
- Technology-neutral regulatory framework
- Performance-based funding allocation

## Limitations

- Panel analysis limited to 4 major cable networks due to data availability
- Government fund coefficient not statistically significant on the small 4-company sample
- Causal interpretation requires caution given potential endogeneity
- License fee analysis is descriptive rather than formally modeled

## Status

**Current Status**: Data analysis and policy design complete
**Target Completion**: 2025
**Planned Submission**: Media policy journal

## Related Work

This research complements the "Broadcasting Revenue Structure Analysis (2015-2024)" project, providing deeper empirical analysis of investment mandates and broader policy perspectives on media ecosystem financing.
