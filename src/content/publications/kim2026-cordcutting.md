## Research Background

Over-the-top (OTT) video platforms are fundamentally reshaping the global media landscape, transforming traditional content distribution methods, viewer engagement models, and revenue generation structures. Industry experts predict that OTT revenue will surge to approximately USD 476 billion by 2027, marking a record-breaking figure that will surpass pay-TV revenue for the first time. This dramatic shift has made understanding consumer "cord-cutting" behavior—the decision to cancel traditional pay-TV subscriptions in favor of streaming services—increasingly critical for both legacy broadcasters and emerging platforms.

Most existing studies have identified cost sensitivity and the availability of desired content as the main factors driving this switch, emphasizing the impact of price sensitivity and content diversity on consumer choice. However, less attention has been paid to the psychological mechanisms that mediate the relationship between service attributes and actual switching behavior.

## Theoretical Framework

This study applies the push-pull-mooring (PPM) framework to systematically examine the factors influencing migration from traditional pay-TV to OTT services. The PPM framework, originally developed in migration studies, conceptualizes switching behavior through three forces: push factors that drive consumers away from their current service, pull factors that attract them to alternatives, and mooring factors that either facilitate or inhibit the switching decision.

Our research proposes a refined structural model that differs from prior studies in an important way. While previous research has largely modeled push, pull, and mooring forces as parallel direct predictors of switching intention, we theorize a sequential path in which negative service attributes shape attitudinal responses, which in turn drive switching intention. Specifically, we incorporate two theoretically and empirically grounded constructs—dissatisfaction and attractiveness of alternatives—as mediators within the PPM framework. Both constructs have been consistently validated in the IS Success Model and Expectation Disconfirmation Theory as influential predictors of user abandonment and switching behaviors.

## Methodology

Building on Kwon and Kim's (2020) application of the PPM framework in the Korean context, this study extends the investigation to American users. Given cultural and institutional differences between Korea and the United States, this extension was essential to enhance external validity—particularly in the United States, where pay-TV churn and OTT adoption are especially pronounced.

Data were collected through a survey of pay-TV and OTT service users in the United States. The proposed model was tested using structural equation modeling to examine the relationships among push factors (system quality, content quality, price value), pull factors (alternative attractiveness), mooring factors (switching costs), mediating variables (dissatisfaction, attractiveness of alternatives), and switching intention.

## Key Findings

The analysis reveals that negative service attributes—specifically low system quality, low content quality, and low perceived price value—significantly influence attitudinal responses toward the current service provider. These push factors increase subscriber dissatisfaction, which in turn strengthens switching intention toward OTT alternatives.

An important finding concerns the differential effects of switching costs. While financial switching costs lacked significant impact on switching intentions, procedural switching costs represented a substantial deterrent, significantly dampening the likelihood that dissatisfied subscribers would actually switch services. This suggests that the time and effort required to learn new platforms and reconfigure viewing habits may be more influential than monetary considerations in inhibiting cord-cutting behavior.

The results also highlight that the attractiveness of alternatives—driven by OTT platforms' content variety, on-demand flexibility, and competitive pricing—plays a mediating role in channeling dissatisfaction into switching intention. Consumers who perceive OTT services as offering superior value are more likely to act on their dissatisfaction with pay-TV.

## Implications

This study offers theoretical contributions by enabling integration between the PPM framework and established models such as the IS Success Model and Expectation Disconfirmation Theory. By positioning dissatisfaction and alternative attractiveness as mediators rather than parallel predictors, the refined model enhances the applicability of the PPM framework in the context of media and technology-based services.

For practitioners, the findings suggest that traditional pay-TV providers should focus on improving service quality and perceived value rather than relying solely on financial barriers to retain subscribers. The significant role of procedural switching costs indicates that simplifying the user experience and maintaining habitual viewing patterns may be more effective retention strategies than contract-based lock-ins. For OTT platforms, the results underscore the importance of reducing perceived switching barriers and communicating the superior value proposition of streaming services to attract cord-cutters.
