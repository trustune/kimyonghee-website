## Overview

This research investigates the cord-cutting phenomenon, where consumers migrate from traditional pay-TV subscriptions to over-the-top (OTT) streaming services. Using the push-pull-mooring framework, we analyze the complex factors that influence this migration decision.

## Research Questions

1. What push factors drive consumers away from pay-TV services?
2. What pull factors attract consumers to OTT platforms?
3. What mooring factors moderate the switching decision?

## Methodology

- **Framework**: Push-Pull-Mooring (PPM) model
- **Data**: Survey of pay-TV and OTT service users
- **Analysis**: Structural equation modeling

## Key Findings

### Push Factors (Away from Pay-TV)
- High subscription costs
- Limited content flexibility
- Contract restrictions
- Declining content quality

### Pull Factors (Toward OTT)
- Content variety and exclusivity
- On-demand viewing flexibility
- Multiple device compatibility
- Personalized recommendations

### Mooring Factors
- Switching costs
- Service habits
- Technical barriers
- Social influence

## Implications

This study provides insights for both traditional broadcasters and OTT platforms in understanding consumer switching behavior and developing retention strategies in the rapidly evolving media landscape.
