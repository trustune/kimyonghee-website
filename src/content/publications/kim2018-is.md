## Research Overview

This study analyzes the complex interrelationships among factors influencing information system (IS) upgrade decisions using Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) and MICMAC analysis, providing insights for sustainable business competitiveness.

## Research Background

### IS Upgrade Importance
- Critical for maintaining competitiveness
- Significant resource commitment required
- High risk and uncertainty
- Long-term business sustainability impact

### Decision Complexity
- Multiple interdependent factors
- Technical and organizational considerations
- Financial and strategic implications
- Stakeholder alignment challenges

## Methodology

### ISM (Interpretive Structural Modeling)
- **Purpose**: Map hierarchical relationships among factors
- **Approach**: Expert-based structural analysis
- **Output**: Multi-level factor hierarchy

### MICMAC Analysis
- **Classification**: Factor categorization by influence
- **Dimensions**: Driving power and dependence
- **Purpose**: Strategic priority identification

### Research Process
1. Literature review and factor identification
2. Expert panel formation
3. Structural self-interaction matrix
4. Reachability matrix development
5. Level partitioning
6. ISM model construction
7. MICMAC classification

## Key Decision Factors Identified

### Technical Factors
- System compatibility
- Technology maturity
- Integration capability
- Performance requirements
- Security considerations

### Organizational Factors
- Strategic alignment
- Organizational readiness
- Change management capability
- User acceptance
- Training requirements

### Financial Factors
- Total cost of ownership
- Return on investment
- Budget availability
- Cost-benefit analysis
- Financial risk assessment

### External Factors
- Vendor support
- Industry standards
- Regulatory compliance
- Market trends
- Competitive pressure

## ISM Hierarchical Structure

### Level 1 (Top): Dependent Variables
- IS upgrade decision
- Business competitiveness
- Sustainability outcomes

### Level 2: Intermediate Variables
- User satisfaction
- System performance
- Process efficiency

### Level 3: Driving Variables
- Strategic alignment
- Technology capability
- Financial viability

### Level 4 (Bottom): Foundation Variables
- Management support
- Organizational culture
- Resource availability

## MICMAC Classification Results

### Driver Variables (High Driving, Low Dependence)
- Top management support
- Strategic business alignment
- Organizational culture
- Resource commitment

**Implications**: These require primary attention as they influence many other factors

### Linkage Variables (High Driving, High Dependence)
- Technology compatibility
- Change management
- User training
- Integration planning

**Implications**: These are critical but also influenced by other factors; require careful management

### Dependent Variables (Low Driving, High Dependence)
- System performance
- User satisfaction
- Business outcomes

**Implications**: These are outcomes rather than drivers; influenced by other factors

### Autonomous Variables (Low Driving, Low Dependence)
- Minimal direct influence
- Peripheral considerations

**Implications**: Low priority in decision-making

## Strategic Implications

### For Decision Makers

**Priority Actions**
1. Secure top management commitment
2. Ensure strategic alignment
3. Build organizational readiness
4. Allocate adequate resources

**Sequential Approach**
- Address driver variables first
- Manage linkage variables carefully
- Monitor dependent variables
- De-emphasize autonomous factors

### For Organizations

**Success Factors**
- Strong leadership support
- Clear strategic rationale
- Comprehensive change management
- Adequate resource allocation
- Stakeholder engagement

**Risk Mitigation**
- Phased implementation
- Pilot testing
- Continuous monitoring
- Flexibility and adaptation

## Sustainability Contributions
