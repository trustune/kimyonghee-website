## Research Background

The digital divide has evolved substantially since its initial conceptualization in the 1990s. First-generation concerns focused on physical access to digital technologies—whether households possessed computers and internet connections. In developed countries including Korea, these access gaps have largely been resolved through infrastructure investment, falling device costs, and near-universal smartphone adoption. However, closing the access gap has not eliminated digital inequality; rather, inequality has transformed into more subtle forms related to how people use digital technologies rather than whether they can access them.

This working paper examines the qualitative dimensions of digital inequality through the lens of media usage time allocation. While all income groups now have access to digital devices and internet connectivity, significant differences persist in how they allocate their digital time between entertainment and productive activities. These usage patterns may have important implications for economic opportunity, skill development, and social mobility.

Using Korea Media Panel data spanning 2019 to 2024, this research analyzes how different income groups allocate their media consumption time and how these patterns have evolved over a six-year period encompassing the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings extend digital divide theory from access and skills to what scholars term the "third-level divide" concerning quality and outcomes of digital engagement.

## Theoretical Framework

Digital divide scholarship has progressed through three conceptual levels. The first-level divide concerns physical access to information and communication technologies. This dimension has received the most policy attention, with governments and international organizations investing substantially in infrastructure deployment and device subsidization programs. In Korea and other developed nations, first-level divides have largely been resolved, with internet access and smartphone ownership approaching universality across income levels.

The second-level divide concerns digital skills and literacy—the capability to use digital technologies effectively. Even with physical access, individuals vary in their ability to navigate digital environments, evaluate online information, and accomplish tasks using digital tools. Second-level divides have narrowed as digital interfaces have become more intuitive and as younger generations who grew up with digital technologies have entered adulthood.

The third-level divide, which this research addresses, concerns the quality and outcomes of digital engagement. Even among populations with equivalent access and skills, usage patterns differ in ways that may reinforce existing inequalities. If higher-income groups use digital technologies primarily for information acquisition, skill development, and professional advancement while lower-income groups use them primarily for entertainment, digital access could paradoxically widen rather than narrow social disparities.

## Data and Methodology

The analysis employs Korea Media Panel Survey data covering the six-year period from 2019 to 2024. This nationally representative longitudinal survey collects detailed information on media consumption patterns, time allocation, device ownership, and demographic characteristics. The panel structure enables tracking of both cross-sectional patterns and temporal trends.

Time allocation analysis categorizes media usage into content types, distinguishing between entertainment-oriented consumption such as video streaming, gaming, and social media entertainment, and productive-oriented usage such as news consumption, educational content, professional services, and skill development activities. This categorization enables assessment of qualitative differences in how different groups engage with digital media.

Income stratification analysis examines usage patterns across income quintiles, revealing how media time allocation varies with household economic resources. Trend analysis examines whether income-based usage gaps have widened, narrowed, or remained stable over the six-year study period, including the pandemic years that disrupted normal media consumption patterns.

## Preliminary Findings

The analysis confirms resolution of first-generation digital divides in Korea. Device ownership gaps have narrowed to negligible levels, with smartphone penetration approaching 100 percent across all income groups. Internet access disparities have similarly diminished, with high-speed connectivity available to the vast majority of households regardless of income. These findings indicate that access-focused policy interventions have achieved their intended objectives.

However, substantial quality gaps emerge in media usage patterns across income strata. Higher-income groups allocate proportionally more of their media time to information and educational content, demonstrating more diverse content diets that include news, professional development materials, and skill-building resources. They also show higher usage of productivity tools and professional services that may enhance economic capabilities.

Lower-income groups display disproportionate time allocation to entertainment content, with concentrated usage patterns focused on video streaming, gaming, and social media entertainment. Their engagement with educational and professional content remains limited despite possessing the access and basic skills necessary for such engagement. These patterns suggest that digital access has not automatically translated into digital opportunity for economic advancement.

The pandemic period showed mixed effects on these patterns. While overall media consumption increased across all income groups during lockdown periods, the relative allocation between entertainment and productive content largely maintained pre-existing patterns. Some evidence suggests that higher-income groups were better positioned to convert increased digital time into skill development and remote work capabilities.

## Theoretical and Policy Implications

These findings extend digital divide theory by demonstrating that access resolution does not automatically produce usage equality. The persistence of quality gaps despite access parity suggests that factors beyond infrastructure and basic skills shape digital engagement patterns. These factors may include digital literacy regarding productive applications, awareness of available resources, social norms within peer networks, and time constraints that favor passive entertainment over active skill development.

Policy implications suggest the need to move beyond infrastructure provision toward interventions that shape usage quality. Media literacy education that helps individuals recognize and access productive digital resources may prove more impactful than additional access investments in contexts where access gaps have closed. Content accessibility initiatives that reduce barriers to educational and professional content could help democratize productive digital engagement. Digital capability building programs that go beyond basic skills to cultivate effective digital practices may address root causes of usage inequality.

## Current Status

The research is at the working paper stage, with primary analysis complete and manuscript preparation underway. Additional robustness checks are planned to validate the categorization scheme and test sensitivity to alternative specifications. Comparative analysis with other countries may be incorporated to assess whether Korean patterns generalize to other contexts. The target journal has not been finalized, with candidates including communication and media studies outlets with interest in digital inequality.
