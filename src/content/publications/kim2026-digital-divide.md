abstract: "This paper examines the evolving nature of digital inequality, moving beyond device access to analyze qualitative differences in media usage time. Using Korea Media Panel data (2019-2024), we find that while first-generation digital divides have been resolved, stark differences persist in how different income groups allocate their media time between entertainment and productive activities."

## Research Background

While first-generation digital divides focusing on device access have largely been resolved in developed countries, new forms of digital inequality have emerged. This working paper examines the qualitative dimensions of digital inequality through the lens of media usage time allocation.

## Research Questions

1. How do different income groups allocate their media usage time?
2. What are the quality gaps in media consumption patterns?
3. How has digital inequality evolved from access to usage patterns?

## Data and Methodology

### Data Source
- **Korea Media Panel Survey** (2019-2024)
- **Sample**: Representative sample of Korean households
- **Period**: 6-year longitudinal data

### Analytical Approach
- Time allocation analysis
- Content categorization (entertainment vs. productive)
- Income stratification analysis
- Trend analysis across years

## Preliminary Findings

### Resolution of First-Generation Divides
- Device ownership gap has narrowed significantly
- Internet access disparities have diminished
- Smartphone penetration near universal across income groups

### Emergence of Quality Gaps

#### High-Income Groups
- More time allocated to information and educational content
- Higher usage of productivity tools and professional services
- Balanced media diet with diverse content types

#### Low-Income Groups
- Disproportionate time on entertainment content
- Limited engagement with educational or professional content
- Concentrated usage patterns

## Theoretical Implications

This research extends digital divide theory from:
- **First level**: Physical access to technology
- **Second level**: Digital skills and literacy
- **Third level**: Quality and outcomes of usage

## Policy Implications

Addressing digital inequality requires moving beyond infrastructure provision to:
- Media literacy education
- Quality content accessibility
- Digital capability building
- Promotion of productive digital engagement

## Next Steps

- Manuscript preparation for journal submission
- Additional robustness checks
- Comparative analysis with other countries
- Policy recommendation development

## Status

**Current Status**: Working Paper  
**Target Journal**: To be determined  
**Expected Submission**: 2025 Q2
