abstract: "Digital technologies have transformed daily life, yet research on digital inequality has focused primarily on access and skills rather than on how people structure their digital engagement across time. Here, we introduce the concept of digital time fragmentation---the degree to which digital use is scattered versus consolidated throughout the day---and examine its socioeconomic patterning using longitudinal time-use diary data from 5,644 individuals in South Korea (2017-2024). We document a Digital Access Paradox: as smartphone penetration approached saturation, low-socioeconomic status individuals shifted from lower-than-average digital fragmentation to higher-than-average fragmentation, a reversal of 0.154 standard deviations. Event study analysis reveals that limited access constrained digital engagement among low-SES groups in 2017; by 2021, a quality gap emerged where low-SES individuals devoted 95% of their digital time to passive consumption compared to 74% among high-SES individuals. These findings identify temporal structure as a distinct dimension of digital inequality that emerges precisely as access gaps close."

## Research Overview

This paper introduces the concept of **digital time fragmentation**---the degree to which digital use is scattered versus consolidated throughout the day---and documents a "Digital Access Paradox" using longitudinal time-use diary data from South Korea. As digital access expands universally, a new form of inequality emerges: not in whether people can connect, but in how they structure their digital engagement.

## Key Concept: Digital Time Fragmentation

Digital time fragmentation captures the temporal structure of digital engagement:
- **Low fragmentation**: Consolidated, purposeful digital sessions
- **High fragmentation**: Scattered, reactive digital interactions throughout the day

This concept moves beyond traditional measures of "screen time" (total hours) to examine the qualitative character of digital engagement.

## Core Findings

### The Digital Access Paradox

A reversal in the socioeconomic patterning of digital engagement:

| Period | Low-SES Fragmentation | High-SES Fragmentation | Gap |
|--------|----------------------|----------------------|-----|
| 2017 | Below average | Above average | Low-SES less fragmented |
| 2021 | Above average | Below average | Low-SES **more** fragmented |

- **Magnitude**: 0.154 standard deviation reversal (P = 0.0002)
- **Mechanism**: As access expanded, low-SES groups adopted scattered, passive consumption patterns

### Quality Gap in Digital Engagement

| Metric | Low-SES | High-SES |
|--------|---------|----------|
| Passive consumption share | 95% | 74% |
| Digital engagement pattern | Scattered, reactive | Consolidated, purposeful |
| Content diversity | Concentrated | Balanced |

### COVID-19 Acceleration
Difference-in-differences analysis indicates that the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated the divergence between SES groups in digital time fragmentation patterns.

## Data and Methodology

### Data Source
- **Korea Media Panel Survey** (2017-2024)
- **Sample**: 5,644 individuals with longitudinal time-use diary data
- **Measures**: Time-use diaries capturing digital engagement episodes throughout the day

### Analytical Approach

1. **Event Study Analysis**: Traces the temporal evolution of the SES-fragmentation relationship
2. **Difference-in-Differences**: Estimates the causal impact of COVID-19 on digital inequality patterns
3. **Specification Curve Analysis**: Tests robustness across 324 analytical specifications---100% of models examining 2017-2021 showed significant effects
4. **Lagged Dependent Variable Models**: Rules out reverse causality, suggesting SES structures media trajectories rather than reflecting stable preferences
5. **Mediation Analysis**: Provides suggestive evidence that fragmentation partially accounts for SES-wellbeing associations

## Theoretical Contributions

This research extends digital divide theory to a third level:
- **First level**: Physical access to technology (largely resolved)
- **Second level**: Digital skills and literacy
- **Third level**: Temporal structure and quality of digital engagement (this paper)

The key insight is that **universal access does not produce equal outcomes**---the qualitative character of digital engagement diverges along socioeconomic lines precisely as quantitative access gaps close.

## Policy Implications

Addressing digital inequality requires moving beyond infrastructure provision:
- **Media literacy education**: Teaching purposeful digital engagement
- **Quality content accessibility**: Reducing barriers to productive content
- **Digital capability building**: Developing consolidated, goal-directed usage habits
- **Temporal awareness**: Policies recognizing that how people engage matters more than whether they can connect

## Significance

The "screen time" debate has dominated discussions of digital technology and wellbeing, yet total hours online may matter less than how that time is organized. Our findings reframe digital inequality from a question of access to one of temporal structure, suggesting that closing the digital divide requires attention to how people engage with technology, not just whether they can connect.
