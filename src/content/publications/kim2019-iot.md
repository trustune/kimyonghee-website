## Research Background

The Internet of Things represents a paradigm shift in how devices, systems, and services interact, promising to transform industries ranging from manufacturing and healthcare to transportation and smart cities. Yet despite substantial technological progress and significant policy attention, the adoption of IoT services has proceeded unevenly across sectors and regions. Understanding the factors that enable or constrain IoT adoption—and how these factors relate to one another—is essential for stakeholders seeking to accelerate the realization of IoT's potential benefits.

The complexity of IoT ecosystems presents particular challenges for adoption analysis. Unlike simpler technologies that can be evaluated in isolation, IoT services depend on intricate combinations of hardware, software, connectivity, platforms, applications, and supporting services. Adoption decisions must consider not only the characteristics of specific IoT solutions but also the broader ecosystem conditions that enable their effective deployment. This multidimensional complexity calls for analytical approaches capable of mapping relationships among diverse enabling factors.

This study addresses the need for systematic analysis of IoT adoption enablers by applying Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) and MICMAC analysis. Drawing on the European Union's Internet of Things Action Plan as a framework for identifying relevant enablers, the research maps the hierarchical relationships among adoption factors and classifies them according to their driving power and dependence. The resulting framework provides guidance for policymakers and industry practitioners seeking to promote IoT service adoption.

## Theoretical Framework

The theoretical foundation of this research integrates perspectives from technology adoption, innovation ecosystems, and policy analysis. Traditional technology adoption models such as TAM and UTAUT focus primarily on individual-level acceptance decisions, examining how perceptions of usefulness, ease of use, and social influence shape adoption intentions. While valuable for understanding consumer behavior, these models may not fully capture the systemic factors that enable or constrain adoption at the market or ecosystem level.

The innovation ecosystems perspective complements individual adoption models by emphasizing the interdependencies among diverse actors, technologies, and institutions that collectively determine innovation outcomes. From this perspective, IoT adoption depends not only on the qualities of specific services but also on the health and maturity of the broader ecosystem—including standards, platforms, regulatory frameworks, and complementary innovations.

The EU's Internet of Things Action Plan provides a policy-oriented framework for identifying enablers relevant to IoT adoption. This action plan identified key areas requiring attention to promote IoT development in Europe, including governance structures, technology standards, privacy and security, and ecosystem development. Drawing on this framework ensures that the analysis addresses enablers recognized as important by policymakers while maintaining alignment with European policy priorities.

Interpretive Structural Modeling provides a methodology appropriate for analyzing the complex interdependencies among IoT adoption enablers. By drawing on expert judgment to establish relationships among factors, ISM reveals the hierarchical structure underlying the adoption ecosystem. MICMAC analysis complements ISM by classifying factors according to their driving power and dependence, enabling strategic prioritization of intervention efforts.

## Methodology

The research proceeded through several methodological stages, beginning with identification of relevant enablers and concluding with structural analysis and classification. The enabler identification stage drew primarily on the EU's Internet of Things Action Plan, supplemented by literature review and expert consultation. This process yielded a comprehensive list of factors spanning technology, business, policy, and social dimensions of IoT adoption.

Expert interviews and surveys gathered the judgments necessary for structural analysis. Participants included IoT industry professionals, technology managers, policy experts, and academic researchers with substantial knowledge of IoT ecosystems. Through structured elicitation procedures, experts assessed pairwise relationships among enablers, indicating whether each factor influences, is influenced by, or has no direct relationship with each other factor.

The structural self-interaction matrix captured expert assessments of pairwise relationships using the standard ISM notation. Conversion to a binary reachability matrix and transitivity checking ensured logical consistency of the relationship structure. Level partitioning assigned enablers to hierarchical levels based on their reachability and antecedent sets, with iteration continuing until all factors were assigned to levels.

MICMAC analysis calculated driving power and dependence scores for each enabler, enabling classification into four strategic categories. The resulting driver-dependence diagram visualizes the strategic positioning of each enabler, distinguishing among autonomous factors with limited system involvement, dependent factors primarily influenced by others, linkage factors that are both influential and influenced, and driver factors that exert strong influence while remaining relatively autonomous.

## Key Findings

The ISM analysis revealed a multi-level hierarchical structure among IoT adoption enablers. At the foundation of the hierarchy, occupying the deepest levels, were enablers related to standards development, regulatory frameworks, and investment support. These foundational elements create the conditions within which other enablers can operate effectively. Without established standards, clear regulations, and adequate investment, higher-level enablers cannot achieve their potential contribution to adoption.

The intermediate levels of the hierarchy contained enablers related to platform development, security solutions, and data management capabilities. These factors translate foundational conditions into more proximate influences on adoption. Platform development, for example, depends on standards that enable interoperability while also shaping the security and data management capabilities that determine platform usefulness.

The upper levels of the hierarchy contained adoption-oriented enablers including user acceptance, service quality, and market outcomes. These dependent factors are shaped by the enablers below them in the hierarchy. User acceptance, for instance, depends on service quality, which in turn depends on platform capabilities, security solutions, and underlying standards and regulations.

MICMAC classification identified distinct strategic categories with clear implications for intervention priorities. Driver variables including policy and regulation, technology standards, and investment support occupied the high driving power, low dependence quadrant. These foundational enablers merit primary attention because they influence numerous other factors while remaining relatively autonomous. Policymakers and industry leaders should prioritize establishing clear regulatory frameworks, promoting standards development, and ensuring adequate investment as foundational requirements for IoT adoption.

Linkage variables including platform development, security solutions, and data management occupied the high driving power, high dependence quadrant. These factors are critical for translating foundational conditions into adoption outcomes but are also vulnerable to disruption from other elements. Effective management of linkage enablers requires attention both to their influence on subsequent factors and to the foundational conditions upon which they depend.

Dependent variables including user adoption, service quality, and market outcomes occupied the low driving power, high dependence quadrant. These outcome-oriented factors reflect the aggregate effects of other enablers in the system. Attempts to directly improve adoption outcomes without addressing underlying drivers are unlikely to succeed sustainably.

## Implications

For policymakers, the hierarchical structure suggests a sequenced approach to IoT promotion. Priority should be given to establishing foundational enablers including clear regulatory frameworks, coordinated standards development, and adequate investment support. These foundational elements create the conditions necessary for subsequent enablers to contribute effectively to adoption. Policy attention that focuses exclusively on adoption promotion without addressing foundational requirements may prove ineffective.

For industry practitioners, the framework highlights the ecosystem dependencies that shape commercial success in IoT markets. Platform developers, for example, should recognize that their success depends not only on their own technical capabilities but also on the maturity of standards, the clarity of regulations, and the availability of complementary security and data management solutions. Strategic planning should account for these ecosystem dependencies rather than treating platform development in isolation.

For researchers, the study demonstrates the value of structural modeling approaches for analyzing complex technology ecosystems. The combination of ISM and MICMAC provides a systematic methodology for mapping relationships and prioritizing factors that can be adapted to other technology domains. Future research should extend this approach to additional geographic contexts and emerging technology areas while developing dynamic models that capture ecosystem evolution over time.
