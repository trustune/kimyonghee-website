abstract: "This study aims to use ISM to identify the enablers affecting the acceptance of IoT services. For this purpose, this study conducted an ISM analysis and a MICMAC analysis, extracted the enablers from Internet of Things-An Action Plan for Europe published by the EU for the research, and conducted interviews and surveys."

## Research Overview

This study employs Interpretive Structural Modeling (ISM) to analyze the hierarchical relationships among enablers affecting IoT service adoption, providing a systematic framework for understanding complex interdependencies.

## Research Motivation

### IoT Adoption Challenges
- Complex ecosystem of technologies

- **Purpose**: Identify hierarchical relationships among variables
- **Process**: Expert judgment-based structural analysis
- **Output**: Multi-level hierarchical model

### MICMAC Analysis
- **Classification**: Driver, linkage, dependent, autonomous
- **Driving Power**: Influence on other variables
- **Dependence**: Influenced by other variables

### Data Collection
- **Source**: EU IoT Action Plan enablers
- **Method**: Expert interviews and surveys
- **Participants**: IoT industry professionals
- **Validation**: Iterative refinement
