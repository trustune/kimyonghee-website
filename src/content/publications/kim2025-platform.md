## Research Background

Platform markets are experiencing a paradoxical evolution: while platforms themselves are becoming increasingly concentrated, their content suppliers are simultaneously fragmenting. This asymmetric market evolution has significant implications for competition, market power, and economic sustainability, yet it remains poorly understood in the academic literature. The Korean home shopping industry provides an ideal setting to examine these dynamics, as it represents one of the world's most developed television commerce markets with a complex relationship between platform operators and content providers.

This study addresses this gap by examining how asymmetric concentration patterns—where platform markets consolidate while content markets fragment—create new sources of platform power that may require novel regulatory approaches beyond traditional competition policy frameworks.

## Theoretical Framework

Traditional platform economics literature has focused primarily on symmetric market structures, where both sides of the platform evolve in parallel. However, the reality of many platform markets suggests a more complex dynamic where platforms and their suppliers follow divergent concentration trajectories. This asymmetric evolution can amplify platform power in ways not captured by conventional market analysis.

We conceptualize platform power through the lens of market concentration differentials, proposing that the ratio between platform-side and content-side concentration serves as a key indicator of competitive imbalance. When platforms concentrate faster than their suppliers fragment, the resulting asymmetry creates bargaining power advantages that manifest in higher fees, less favorable contract terms, and reduced supplier profitability.

## Methodology

Using panel data from 11–12 Korean home shopping firms spanning 2015–2023, we employ a multi-method empirical approach to examine the competitive impact of asymmetric market evolution. Our dataset comprises 104 firm-year observations covering the full spectrum of market participants, from dominant platforms to smaller content providers.

We apply Hansen threshold regression to identify critical fee thresholds that divide the market into distinct operating regimes. Instrumental variables estimation addresses potential endogeneity concerns, while panel fixed-effects models control for unobserved firm-level heterogeneity. This combination of techniques allows us to isolate the causal effect of market concentration on platform fees and supplier outcomes while accounting for selection bias and omitted variable concerns.

## Key Findings

Our analysis reveals that platform concentration alone explains 94.4% of the variation in transmission fees charged to content providers. As platform-side HHI increased from 1390 to 2154 over the study period, while content-side HHI simultaneously declined from 1797 to 1118, transmission fees rose dramatically from 41.15% to 68.72% of transaction value. This finding demonstrates the substantial explanatory power of asymmetric concentration dynamics.

We identify two critical fee thresholds that divide the market into three distinct operating regimes. The first threshold at 62.2% (p = 0.012) separates competitive markets from moderately concentrated ones, while the second threshold at 73% (p = 0.002) marks the boundary of highly concentrated markets where platform power is most pronounced.

Perhaps most striking is the reversal in the relationship between fees and profitability over the study period. The correlation shifted from negative (r = −0.145) in early years to positive (r = 0.554) in later periods. This reversal indicates that transmission fees evolved from simple cost burdens—where higher fees reduced profits—to selection mechanisms where only the most profitable firms could survive elevated fee levels.

Our instrumental variable estimates reveal severe selection bias in naive OLS specifications. The IV coefficient (0.473) exceeds the OLS estimate (0.184) by 2.6 times, suggesting that firms with better unobserved characteristics self-select into high-fee environments. This finding has important implications for policy analysis based on observational data.

## Policy Implications

Based on our findings, we propose the Asymmetry Ratio—calculated as Platform HHI divided by Content HHI—as a practical regulatory tool for identifying markets where asymmetric evolution may be creating excessive platform power. We recommend that ratios exceeding 1.0 trigger enhanced regulatory scrutiny, as they indicate that platform concentration outpaces content fragmentation.

Our simulations indicate that a 60% fee cap would affect 25 firms (24% of the market) while generating substantial welfare improvements. Specifically, such a cap would increase total economic surplus by 15.1% and improve SME profitability by 2.9 percentage points. These findings suggest that targeted intervention in the form of fee regulation could address the market failures created by asymmetric evolution without requiring fundamental restructuring of the industry.

## Contributions

This study makes three primary contributions to the literature on platform economics and competition policy. Theoretically, we introduce the concept of asymmetric market evolution and demonstrate its relevance for understanding platform power dynamics. Empirically, we provide the first comprehensive quantitative analysis of how divergent concentration trajectories affect platform fees and supplier outcomes. For policy, we offer a practical regulatory framework—the Asymmetry Ratio—that can guide competition authorities in identifying markets where novel interventions may be required.

Our findings demonstrate that asymmetric market evolution creates new sources of platform power that may not be adequately addressed by traditional competition policy tools focused on horizontal concentration alone. As platform markets continue to evolve globally, regulatory frameworks must adapt to account for these more complex competitive dynamics.
