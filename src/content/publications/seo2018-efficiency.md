## Research Background

The digital transformation of government services represents one of the most significant public sector reforms of the twenty-first century. Korea's Government 3.0 initiative, launched as part of a broader vision for transparent, competent, and service-oriented government, exemplifies the ambitious scope of such reforms. This initiative sought to leverage information and communication technologies to enhance public service delivery, promote open government principles, and foster citizen participation in governance processes.

Despite substantial investments in e-government infrastructure and significant policy attention to digital transformation, the effectiveness of these initiatives varies considerably across government agencies. Some agencies have successfully leveraged digital technologies to improve service quality and operational efficiency, while others have struggled to realize the promised benefits of digitalization. Understanding the sources of this variation—and identifying the factors that distinguish high-performing agencies from their less efficient counterparts—is essential for guiding future reform efforts and maximizing the public value created through digital government investments.

This study addresses the need for rigorous efficiency assessment in the e-government context by evaluating the Government 3.0 performance of 42 central administrative agencies in Korea. Using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), the research identifies which agencies have most effectively transformed their digital investments into public service outcomes, while Tobit regression analysis reveals the organizational and contextual factors that influence efficiency levels.

## Theoretical Framework

Efficiency measurement in the public sector presents unique conceptual and methodological challenges. Unlike private firms, which can be evaluated primarily on financial performance, government agencies pursue multiple objectives—including equity, accessibility, and democratic accountability—that resist simple quantification. The Government 3.0 initiative explicitly embraces this multidimensional perspective, encompassing goals related to transparency, competence, and service orientation.

Data Envelopment Analysis provides a methodologically appropriate approach to public sector efficiency assessment. As a non-parametric technique, DEA does not require specification of a production function linking inputs to outputs, instead constructing an empirical efficiency frontier based on observed best practices. This approach accommodates the multiple inputs and outputs characteristic of government operations while allowing agencies to be evaluated relative to their peers rather than against an externally imposed standard.

The theoretical framework for understanding efficiency determinants draws upon the public management literature on organizational performance. Leadership commitment, organizational culture, resource availability, and technical capacity have all been identified as potential influences on public sector performance. In the e-government context, these general factors are complemented by technology-specific considerations, including system integration, user interface design, and digital skills among both staff and citizens.

## Methodology

The study employed a two-stage analytical approach to assess Government 3.0 efficiency across Korea's central administrative agencies. In the first stage, Data Envelopment Analysis was applied to calculate efficiency scores for each of the 42 agencies included in the sample. The DEA model incorporated multiple input and output variables to capture the multidimensional nature of e-government performance.

Input variables reflected the resources committed to Government 3.0 implementation, including information technology investment and budget allocations, personnel resources dedicated to digital service development and maintenance, infrastructure capacity measured through system capabilities and platform development, and training expenditure reflecting investments in building staff digital competencies.

Output variables captured the results of these investments in terms of service delivery and citizen engagement. These included service quality metrics derived from system performance and user satisfaction assessments, citizen satisfaction scores obtained through surveys and feedback mechanisms, digital service adoption rates reflecting the extent to which citizens utilize online government services, and transaction volumes measuring the scale of digital service delivery.

The second stage employed Tobit regression to identify the determinants of efficiency scores. Tobit regression is appropriate when the dependent variable is bounded—in this case, DEA efficiency scores that range from zero to one—as it accounts for the censored nature of the distribution. Independent variables in the Tobit model captured organizational characteristics, leadership factors, and contextual conditions hypothesized to influence e-government efficiency.

## Key Findings

The DEA analysis revealed substantial variation in Government 3.0 efficiency across Korea's central administrative agencies. The distribution of efficiency scores indicated that while some agencies had achieved efficiency levels approaching the frontier, a significant number operated well below their potential. This finding suggests considerable scope for performance improvement through adoption of best practices from leading agencies.

Efficiency scores distributed agencies into three broad categories. Twelve agencies achieved high efficiency scores exceeding 0.8, demonstrating strong performance in converting digital investments into public service outcomes. These high-performing agencies tended to share characteristics including strong leadership commitment to digital transformation, innovative organizational cultures, and well-developed technical capabilities.

Twenty-two agencies fell into the medium efficiency category, with scores between 0.5 and 0.8. These agencies showed mixed performance, with strengths in some dimensions of Government 3.0 implementation offset by weaknesses in others. For these agencies, targeted improvements in specific areas could yield significant efficiency gains.

Eight agencies demonstrated low efficiency, with scores below 0.5. These underperforming units struggled to translate their digital investments into commensurate service improvements. Analysis of these cases revealed common challenges including resistance to organizational change, legacy system constraints, skill gaps among staff, and limited budget flexibility.

The Tobit regression analysis identified several critical success factors for Government 3.0 efficiency. Leadership commitment emerged as a fundamental driver, with agencies whose top management actively championed digital transformation achieving significantly higher efficiency scores. This finding underscores the importance of visible, sustained support from agency leadership in overcoming organizational barriers to change.

Organizational culture also significantly influenced efficiency outcomes. Agencies characterized by innovation-friendly environments, openness to experimentation, and tolerance for calculated risk demonstrated superior performance. Conversely, agencies with traditional bureaucratic cultures that emphasized rule-following over innovation tended to underperform.

Technical factors including system integration, user interface design, and data quality showed significant relationships with efficiency. Agencies that had achieved interoperability across their information systems and developed citizen-friendly service interfaces demonstrated higher efficiency, while those struggling with fragmented systems and poor data quality lagged behind.

## Implications

For government agency managers, the findings provide actionable guidance for improving Government 3.0 performance. Priority should be given to securing visible leadership commitment, as top management support creates the organizational conditions necessary for successful digital transformation. Leaders should actively communicate the vision for digital government, allocate resources to transformation initiatives, and model the behaviors they expect from staff.

Building an innovation-supportive organizational culture requires sustained attention to values, norms, and incentive structures. Agencies should recognize and reward innovative behaviors, create safe spaces for experimentation, and celebrate successes in digital service improvement. Staff training and capability development are essential complements to cultural change, ensuring that employees have the skills needed to contribute to digital transformation.

Technical investments should prioritize interoperability and user experience. System integration enables seamless service delivery across agency boundaries, while intuitive user interfaces promote citizen adoption. Data quality improvements support both operational efficiency and the analytical capabilities that enable continuous service enhancement.

For central government policymakers, the findings suggest the value of establishing unified digital government strategies that provide coherent direction across agencies while allowing flexibility in implementation. Adequate budget allocation, regulatory framework modernization, and inter-agency coordination platforms can support agency-level transformation efforts. Performance monitoring systems that track efficiency metrics can help identify agencies in need of additional support while recognizing and disseminating best practices from high performers.

## Contributions

This study makes several contributions to the e-government and public management literatures. Methodologically, it demonstrates the application of DEA to assess e-government efficiency, providing a model that other researchers can adapt to different contexts. Empirically, it offers comprehensive evidence on efficiency variation across a complete set of central government agencies, revealing the magnitude of performance differences and the factors that explain them. For practice, the research provides evidence-based recommendations for improving Government 3.0 implementation, informed by analysis of what distinguishes high-performing agencies from their peers.
