## Research Background

The rapid advancement of information and communications technologies has catalyzed remarkable growth in markets related to virtual reality. Mobile-based VR devices have made immersive experiences increasingly accessible to consumers, expanding the potential market for VR applications beyond early adopters and technology enthusiasts. Global technology companies including Google, Facebook, Sony, and Samsung Electronics have invested heavily in virtual reality, competing for dominant positions in this emerging market through innovative products and services spanning gaming, education, tourism, and entertainment.

Among the most ambitious VR applications are virtual reality theme parks, which offer consumers immersive entertainment experiences that combine the excitement of traditional amusement parks with the technological possibilities of virtual environments. These facilities enable experiences that would be impossible or prohibitively expensive in physical form, from space exploration to fantastical adventures. However, the economic viability of VR theme parks depends critically on consumers' willingness to pay for these novel experiences.

Understanding consumer valuation of VR entertainment services is essential for business planning and investment decisions in this emerging industry. This study addresses this need by applying the contingent valuation method to estimate consumers' willingness to pay for virtual reality theme park experiences. The findings provide insights into market potential and pricing strategies for VR entertainment services.

## Methodology

The Contingent Valuation Method (CVM) provides a survey-based approach to economic valuation of goods and services, particularly those that are not yet available in markets or that have characteristics making market-based valuation difficult. CVM elicits stated preferences from potential consumers through carefully designed survey instruments that present hypothetical market scenarios and ask respondents about their willingness to pay for specified products or services.

The survey instrument was developed following established CVM protocols to minimize potential biases and ensure reliable valuation estimates. The survey presented detailed descriptions of virtual reality theme park experiences, including the types of attractions available, the quality and immersiveness of VR content, the duration of experiences, and other relevant service characteristics. This detailed specification ensured that respondents had sufficient information to form meaningful valuations.

The bid design employed established elicitation formats to capture willingness to pay. Respondents were presented with hypothetical prices and asked whether they would be willing to pay those amounts for specified VR theme park experiences. The bid amounts were varied across respondents to enable estimation of demand curves and central tendency measures of willingness to pay.

Statistical analysis employed logit models to analyze the relationship between bid amounts and acceptance probabilities. This approach enables estimation of mean and median willingness to pay while accommodating the binary nature of acceptance decisions. Demographic and attitudinal variables were included to examine how willingness to pay varies across consumer segments.

## Key Findings

The analysis revealed positive willingness to pay for virtual reality theme park experiences, confirming consumer interest in this emerging entertainment category. The mean willingness to pay exceeded current pricing for comparable entertainment experiences, suggesting viable market potential for VR theme parks. This finding provides encouragement for entrepreneurs and investors considering entry into the VR entertainment market.

Consumers demonstrated willingness to pay premiums for high-quality immersive content. Experiences described as highly immersive, with realistic graphics and engaging narratives, commanded significantly higher valuations than more basic VR offerings. This finding suggests that investment in content quality can be justified through higher pricing and that VR theme parks should prioritize content development to maximize consumer value.

Demographic analysis revealed significant variation in willingness to pay across consumer segments. Younger respondents generally expressed higher willingness to pay for VR experiences, reflecting both greater familiarity with digital technologies and higher receptivity to novel entertainment formats. Income showed positive association with willingness to pay, suggesting that VR theme parks may initially target higher-income consumers before expanding to broader markets as costs decline.

Prior experience with virtual reality technology influenced valuation positively. Respondents who had previously used VR devices expressed higher willingness to pay, suggesting that trial experiences can stimulate demand by demonstrating the value of immersive entertainment. VR theme park operators might consider offering introductory experiences or demonstrations to expand the pool of potential customers willing to pay full prices.

## Implications

For VR entertainment business planning, the findings support the economic viability of virtual reality theme park concepts. Consumer willingness to pay appears sufficient to support sustainable business models, particularly for facilities offering high-quality immersive experiences. Pricing strategies should account for the premium consumers place on content quality, with higher prices justified for superior experiences.

Target market identification should consider the demographic patterns in willingness to pay. Initial market entry might focus on younger, higher-income consumers who demonstrate greatest receptivity to VR entertainment. Marketing and communication strategies should emphasize the unique experiences available through VR that cannot be replicated in traditional entertainment venues.

Investment in content development appears warranted given the premium valuations for high-quality experiences. VR theme parks competing on content quality rather than price may achieve superior market positions. Partnerships with content creators, game developers, and entertainment studios could enhance content offerings and justify premium pricing.

For the broader VR industry, the findings suggest healthy demand potential for consumer-facing applications. As VR technology continues to improve and costs decline, the market for immersive entertainment experiences is likely to expand substantially. Early movers who establish brand recognition and content libraries may achieve lasting competitive advantages.
