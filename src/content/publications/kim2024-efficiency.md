## Research Background

The global media landscape has undergone dramatic transformation in recent years, with streaming platforms and traditional broadcasters competing intensely for viewer attention. Almost all players of small and large sizes in the industry spend enormous resources on content and expand their investment to retain global and regional content to win the battle of viewership. However, the efficiency of these investments varies substantially across media companies, making measurement of operational efficiency increasingly crucial as all firms strive to achieve better productivity.

This study differs from earlier research on the efficiency of media companies in an important respect. Prior studies could not consider the significant changes in TV-watching behavior and productivity caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic fundamentally altered how consumers consume entertainment and media, with global streaming consumption soaring as safety restrictions encouraged people to stay home and turn to online video streaming services. Understanding how these shifts affected firm-level productivity provides valuable insights for industry participants and policymakers alike.

Estimating the efficiencies and productivities of firms producing and offering intangible assets—such as TV and movie content—and valuing the content's contribution to firm performance presents particular analytical challenges. This study addresses these challenges by applying well-established efficiency measurement techniques to a comprehensive dataset of media companies spanning the pandemic period.

## Theoretical Framework

Efficiency measurement in the media industry requires careful consideration of the unique characteristics of content production and distribution. Unlike manufacturing industries where inputs and outputs are readily quantifiable, media companies produce intangible assets whose value depends heavily on consumer preferences, timing, and distribution channels. Traditional financial metrics alone cannot fully capture the operational efficiency of content-producing firms.

Data Envelopment Analysis provides a non-parametric approach to efficiency measurement that accommodates multiple inputs and outputs without requiring specification of a production function. By identifying the efficiency frontier based on observed best practices, DEA allows benchmarking of individual firms against industry leaders while accounting for the heterogeneity of business models and strategic orientations in the media sector.

The Malmquist Productivity Index extends this analysis to the temporal dimension, decomposing productivity changes into efficiency change and technical change components. This decomposition is particularly valuable for understanding whether productivity improvements stem from firms catching up to the efficiency frontier or from advancement of the frontier itself through technological or organizational innovation.

## Methodology

Using longitudinal data from 25 major content provider companies—including both OTT platforms and traditional broadcasters—spanning the four-year period from 2019 to 2022, this study applies a two-stage analytical approach. The sample encompasses a diverse range of media companies to ensure comprehensive coverage of the industry landscape during this transformative period.

The first stage employs Data Envelopment Analysis to answer which firms in the media industry have effectively exploited their resources to achieve better firm performance. Input variables capture the resources committed to content production and distribution, including operating expenses, content production costs, personnel expenditures, and capital investments. Output variables measure the results of these investments in terms of revenue generation, audience reach, and market positioning.

The second stage applies Malmquist Productivity Index analysis to examine how the efficiencies and productivity of content providers changed along with the dynamics of the media industry. By comparing efficiency frontiers across adjacent time periods, this analysis reveals the sources of productivity change—whether from efficiency improvements, technological progress, or some combination thereof.

## Key Findings

The analysis reveals substantial heterogeneity in operational efficiency across media companies. Firms differ markedly in their ability to convert resources into viewership and revenue, with the efficiency gap between leaders and laggards remaining significant throughout the study period. These differences reflect not only scale effects but also variations in content strategy, technology adoption, and organizational capabilities.

The COVID-19 pandemic created a natural experiment in media consumption, with the surge in streaming activity during 2020-2021 affecting companies differentially based on their platform capabilities and content libraries. OTT-native companies generally demonstrated stronger efficiency gains during this period, benefiting from infrastructure investments made prior to the pandemic. Traditional broadcasters showed more varied performance, with some successfully pivoting to digital distribution while others struggled to adapt.

Malmquist Index decomposition indicates that productivity changes in the media industry during 2019-2022 were driven by both efficiency improvements and technical progress. Companies that invested in streaming technology and data analytics capabilities showed stronger technical change components, while those focusing on operational optimization demonstrated efficiency catch-up effects. The relative importance of these drivers varied by company type and strategic orientation.

The findings also highlight the importance of content investment efficiency. Companies that achieved better returns on content spending—measured by viewership and subscriber growth relative to production budgets—consistently ranked higher in overall efficiency scores. This suggests that content quality and audience targeting capabilities serve as key differentiators in the increasingly competitive media landscape.

## Implications

For media company managers, the findings underscore the importance of systematic efficiency benchmarking and continuous improvement. Understanding one's position relative to the efficiency frontier provides actionable insights for resource allocation and strategic planning. Companies lagging in efficiency should analyze the practices of industry leaders to identify opportunities for operational enhancement.

For policymakers and regulators, the study provides a framework for assessing industry competitiveness and identifying potential market structure concerns. Efficiency analysis can inform regulatory decisions regarding merger review, market entry barriers, and support for domestic content production. The demonstrated variation in efficiency across companies also suggests scope for industry-wide productivity improvements through knowledge sharing and best practice dissemination.

The study contributes to the academic literature by demonstrating the applicability of DEA and Malmquist methods to the media industry context, addressing the methodological challenges of measuring efficiency in content-producing firms. The findings provide a baseline for future research examining how ongoing industry transformations—including the rise of ad-supported streaming tiers and intensifying global competition—affect firm-level productivity.
