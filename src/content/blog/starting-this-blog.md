Hello! I'm excited to start this blog as a new space to share my thoughts and insights.

## Why This Blog?

As a researcher and educator in media policy and management, I've always believed in the importance of sharing knowledge and fostering dialogue. This blog will serve as a platform where I can:

- Share insights from my research on media policy, OTT platforms, and digital regulation
- Discuss current trends in media and technology
- Reflect on my teaching and research experiences
- Engage with broader questions about the future of media

## What to Expect

I'll be writing about topics that intersect media, policy, and technology. Some posts will be more academic, while others will be more reflective or commentary-driven. I hope this becomes a space for meaningful exchange of ideas.

Thank you for visiting, and I look forward to sharing this journey with you.
