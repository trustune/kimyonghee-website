On November 8th, I had the privilege of participating in the Korean Association for Broadcasting & Telecommunication Studies (KABTS) Fall Conference, where I presented three research studies addressing critical issues facing Korea's media industry. It was a deeply meaningful opportunity to engage in substantive discussions with academic colleagues and industry practitioners.

I'd like to share the key findings and implications from my presentations.

## 1. Sustainable Media Ecosystem Financing (KOBACO Session)

In the KOBACO session, I presented on "Restructuring Government Financing for a Sustainable Media Ecosystem." Despite nominal revenue growth of 18.9% over the past decade, Korea's media industry faces a stark reality: real revenue inflow has stagnated at just 0.1%a classic case of "nominal growth illusion."

The structural collapse of broadcast advertising revenue (-43.5%) and the 44-year freeze on public broadcasting license fees have depleted the industry's capacity for reinvestment. My presentation highlighted how these policy failures have intensified the industry crisis and proposed a concrete policy roadmap including:

- Normalizing KBS license fees
- Immediate deregulation of broadcast advertising restrictions
- Easing platform operators' contributions to the Broadcasting Development Fund

The Q&A session was particularly engaging, with insightful questions from KOBACO representatives and industry stakeholders about implementation strategies and regulatory challenges.

## 2. Korea-US OTT Switching Behavior Analysis

Second, I shared research on "Analyzing OTT Switching Behavior Across Korea-US Markets" (co-authored with Daekyu Kim). To understand the mechanisms driving consumer migration from pay-TV to OTT, we applied the Push-Pull-Mooring framework combined with four methodologies: SEM, NCA, fsQCA, and Causal ML.

A key finding: "pull" factors (attractiveness of alternative OTT services) are 4.35 times more powerful than "push" factors (dissatisfaction with existing services) in driving switching intentions. Notably, unlike the US market's high-cost structure, Korea's entrenched ultra-low-cost pay-TV pricing means that cost (push) is not a driverinstead, content attractiveness (pull) emerges as the sole and critical determinant of switching behavior.

## 3. Digital Inequality of Time: Quality Gaps in Usage

Finally, through my research on "Digital Inequality of Time," I examined the underside of digital transformation. Analyzing longitudinal data from the Korea Media Panel (2019-2024), I found that while first-generation digital divides (device access) have essentially been resolved across income strata, stark differences persist in "quality of use" (third-generation divide).

Lower-income groups spend more total time on media (a "time paradox"), but dedicate 88% of that time to entertainment. In contrast, higher-income groups allocate 35% of their media time to "productive activities" such as news consumption, information search, and learning. This qualitative gap in time usage (productivity index: 5.3% vs 34.5%) translates into differences in human capital accumulation, ultimately operating as a new mechanism of social stratification.

## Dialogue and Future Directions

The sessions across all three topics were particularly engaging. Sharp questions from academics and industry professionals led to in-depth discussions on media financing challenges, competitive market dynamics, and digital inclusion.

This conference reaffirmed the complex, multifaceted challenges confronting the media environment and deepened my sense of responsibility as a researcher. I remain committed to providing practical policy alternatives for our rapidly evolving media landscape through evidence-based empirical research.

My gratitude to the KABTS organizing committee and all participants for making this such a productive and thought-provoking event. I look forward to continuing these important conversations.
