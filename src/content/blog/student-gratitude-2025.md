![A gift from my student](/images/blog/pp.jpg)

A small token of gratitude from a student I wrote a recommendation letter for. Hearing that they've been accepted into a top graduate program brings me quiet joy. I'm just glad I could be of some help on their journey. Wishing them nothing but the best in this new chapter.

These moments remind me why I chose this path. Teaching and mentoring aren't just about transmitting knowledge -- they're about supporting students as they discover their potential and pursue their dreams.

Congratulations to my student. Your success is yours alone, earned through hard work and dedication. I'm honored to have played even a small part in your journey.
