## Executive Summary

<div style="font-size: 1.125rem; line-height: 1.75;">

This research conducts an empirical analysis of Korea's broadcasting reapproval system, focusing on content investment regulations for comprehensive channels (종편) from 2015 to 2024. The study reveals a critical **investment paradox**: higher content investment ratios correlate with poorer business performance, contradicting the intended policy objectives.

Based on comprehensive data analysis including regression models and international comparisons, this research demonstrates that the current 70% content investment requirement may be counterproductive to both industry sustainability and content quality improvement.

### Key Discovery: The Investment Paradox

TV Chosun exceeded the 70% requirement with an average 73.5% investment ratio, yet faced persistent financial difficulties. Statistical analysis shows negative correlations between investment ratios and both Return on Investment (ROI) and operating profit margins, suggesting fundamental flaws in current regulatory design.

## Research Background

### Broadcasting Reapproval System in Korea

Korea's Broadcasting Act stipulates reapproval within 7 years, but in practice, comprehensive channels (종편) receive only 3-4 years (average 3.5 years), with strict content investment requirements of 70% of broadcasting business revenue. This system, introduced in 2011, aims to ensure quality content production and prevent monopolistic practices.

### Problem Statement

Despite over a decade of implementation, questions arise about the effectiveness of current regulations:

1. **Sustainability Concerns**: Financial difficulties persist despite meeting investment requirements
2. **International Disparity**: Korea's actual 3.5-year period significantly shorter than global standards
3. **Market Environment Changes**: Digital transformation and OTT competition not reflected in regulations
4. **Substitution Effects**: Broadcasting Development Fund may be crowding out content investment

<hr class="section-divider">

## Key Findings

### 1. The Investment Paradox

**Statistical Evidence of Negative Correlation**

Regression analysis reveals counterintuitive relationships between content investment and business performance:

<div class="image-container">
<img src="/images/projects/broadcasting-reapproval/09_투자비율_ROI_관계_v4.1_20251010.png" alt="Content Investment Ratio vs ROI">
<div class="image-caption">Figure 1: Negative correlation between content investment ratio and ROI</div>
</div>

**Regression Results**:
- **ROI Model**: Content investment ratio increase of 1% → ROI decrease of 0.34%
- **Operating Margin Model**: Investment ratio increase of 1% → Operating margin decrease of 0.28%
- **Statistical Significance**: Both relationships significant at p < 0.01 level

<div class="warning-box">
<strong>Paradox Identified:</strong> Higher compliance with investment requirements correlates with worse financial performance, suggesting regulatory design flaws.

## Research Methodology

### Econometric Models

**Model 1: ROI Determinants**

```
ROI = β₀ + β₁(Investment_Ratio) + β₂(Market_Share) + β₃(Revenue_Growth) 
      + β₄(Fund_Contribution) + Year_FE + Channel_FE + ε
```

**Model 2: Operating Profit Margin**

```
OP_Margin = β₀ + β₁(Investment_Ratio) + β₂(Revenue) + β₃(Leverage) 
            + β₄(Competition_Index) + Year_FE + Channel_FE + ε
```

**Model 3: Investment Substitution**

```
Content_Investment = β₀ + β₁(Fund_Contribution) + β₂(Revenue) 
                     + β₃(Reapproval_Dummy) + Channel_FE + ε
```

### Data Validation

**Three-Stage Validation Process**:

1. **Internal Consistency**: Cross-checking financial statements with disclosure data
2. **Temporal Consistency**: Verifying year-over-year changes align with industry trends
3. **External Validation**: Comparing with Korea Communications Commission official reports

**Data Quality**:
- Sample size: 10 years × 4 comprehensive channels = 40 observations
- Missing data: < 2% (imputed using previous year average)
- Outlier treatment: Winsorization at 1st and 99th percentiles

<hr class="section-divider">

## Policy Implications

**Phase 1: Immediate Adjustments (2025-2026)**

#### Relax Content Investment Ratio
- **Current**: 70% mandatory
- **Proposed**: 60-65% with flexibility corridor
- **Rationale**: Align with international standards and market realities

#### Extend Reapproval Period
- **Current**: 7 years
- **Proposed**: 10 years (matching UK, Japan)
- **Benefits**: 
  - Reduced regulatory uncertainty
  - Improved long-term investment planning
  - Lower administrative burden

**Phase 2: Structural Reforms (2027-2029)**

#### Introduce Performance-Based Evaluation
Replace rigid quantitative requirements with:
- Content quality metrics (viewer ratings, critical reviews)
- Innovation indicators (new format development, technology adoption)
