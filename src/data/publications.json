      "abstract": "This paper develops a stochastic R&D model of platform investment under mandatory data portability. A Hotelling microfoundation disciplines the revenue-displacement channel. R&D uncertainty and portability are complementary distortions that together depress investment more than either force alone. Calibrating to Korea's MyData initiative, the model implies a welfare inversion: Korea's regime generates deadweight loss more than twice the unregulated monopoly benchmark. Behavioral monitoring attains 90.5 percent of first-best welfare while preserving appropriability.",

As smartphone penetration approached saturation, low-SES individuals shifted from lower to higher digital fragmentation than high-SES counterparts, a reversal of 0.154 standard deviations. Low-SES individuals devoted 95% of digital time to passive consumption versus 74% for high-SES. Specification curve analysis across 324 specifications confirms robustness.",
