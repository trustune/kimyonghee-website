      "abstract": "Data portability mandates represent a new class of innovation policy that fundamentally alters appropriability regimes in digital markets. This paper develops a framework linking regulatory design to investment outcomes, introducing the Data Portability Regulatory Index (DPRI). Applying this framework to Korea's MyData initiative reveals that high-intensity mandates (DPRI = 0.925) may reduce platform investment by approximately 62 percent compared to the unregulated baseline.",
