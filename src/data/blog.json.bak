      "content": "<p>On November 11th, 2025, I participated as a discussant at the National Assembly forum titled 'Policy Directions for Securing K-Content IP Sovereignty and Revitalizing the Domestic Industry,' hosted by the National Assembly's Media & Communications Forum.</p><img src='/images/blog/사진1.jpg' alt='Forum Program' style='width:100%; margin:2rem 0; border-radius:0.5rem;' /><h2>The Real Crisis: Not Production Capability, But Revenue Models</h2><p>Professor Lee Seong-min's presentation accurately diagnosed the structural problems facing the K-content industry. I fully agree with the core argument that this is 'a crisis of revenue models, not production capability.' In my discussion, I applied a business economics framework to deepen the analysis, focusing particularly on the gap between IP ownership and IP utilization.</p><h2>1. The Essence of the Crisis: Collapse of Derived Demand</h2><p>The broadcasting industry data presented in the paper is always shocking. In 2024, revenue declined by 0.9% in reverse growth, and operating profit plummeted by 26.7%. More seriously, advertising revenue decreased from 2.7 trillion won in 2020 to 2.3 trillion won in 2024 - a loss of 420 billion won. This represents a structural collapse of derived demand for content.</p><p>The domestic OTT situation reveals another dimension of the problem. According to the paper, OTT usage reached 89.3% in 2024, indicating market saturation, while average monthly spending on paid OTT actually decreased from 12,005 won to 10,500 won. This is not subscription fatigue but rather a combination of market saturation and price resistance.</p><h2>2. The Real Options Value of IP and the Utilization Gap</h2><p>The paper defined IP as both a brand and a pipeline. Here, I want to apply the real options framework. Content IP is not merely an asset but a right to create uncertain future value streams - Season 2, games, merchandising, theme parks - at the present moment.</p><p>The Squid Game case presented in the paper perfectly demonstrates this. Netflix secured IP ownership, and when the content became a global hit, they produced Seasons 2 and 3, held experiential events in New York, collaborated with global brands like Xbox, Domino's Pizza, and Johnnie Walker, and proceeded with worldwide merchandising.</p><h2>3. The Critical Point: Not IP Ownership, But IP Utilization</h2><p>An important misconception must be corrected here. Currently, only about 15% of deals with global OTTs involve complete IP abandonment - receiving full production costs plus fixed margins while transferring all rights. The remaining 85% already involve shared IP investment and revenue distribution structures.</p><p>So what's the problem? The issue is not IP ownership itself, but the inability to actually utilize the secured IP. The 'Extraordinary Attorney Woo' case illustrates this core problem. Production company AStory secured the IP, but subsequent webtoon adaptations and merchandising fell short of expectations. This represents a separation between IP ownership and IP utilization capability.</p><h2>4. The IP Utilization Cost Gap</h2><p>In Hollywood, marketing costs (P&A: Prints and Advertising) typically amount to 30-50% of production costs, and for blockbusters, over 100%. For a 16-episode drama at 3 billion won per episode, that's 48 billion won in production costs, requiring an additional 24 billion won in marketing costs (at 50%). This 24 billion won utilization cost gap is the critical capital barrier preventing IP sovereignty realization.</p><p>Domestic IP industry scale is 33.2 trillion won, only 22% of the total content industry (151 trillion won), and 87.6% of IP business remains within content expansion like webtoon-to-drama adaptations. True value-add linking content with commerce remains very weak. This is a failure of value chain integration - IP is secured but not utilized.</p><h2>5. Policy Directions: Building an IP Utilization Ecosystem</h2><p>Current policies mostly focus on IP ownership. However, reality shows that 85% of deals already involve shared IP ownership. The problem is not securing IP, but utilizing it. Even when production companies secure IP, like Attorney Woo, they have no means to utilize it.</p><p><strong>First, foster Korean-style production committees.</strong> Like the Demon Slayer model proposed in the paper, we need a strategy of first proving success based on a strong domestic market before expanding globally. Production companies, domestic platforms, and commerce partners should first verify and secure revenue in the domestic market as the first window, then enhance global negotiation power.</p><p><strong>Second, establish a K-IP Commercialization Agency.</strong> Currently, character licensing fairs and content IP markets operate in fragmentation. This agency should integrate existing programs while focusing on actual matching with global brands. Not just setting up booths at exhibitions, but directly connecting specific brands like Johnnie Walker or Xbox with Korean production companies to create concrete collaboration projects.</p><p><strong>Third, strengthen the self-sustaining power of the domestic ecosystem.</strong> As emphasized in the paper, securing domestic demand is key to negotiation power. Negotiation power comes from BATNA (Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement). Tving and Wavve are currently pursuing integration, and domestic platforms must differentiate through local content concentration and close cooperation strategies with production companies.</p><p><strong>Fourth, consider selective financial support as an initial catalyst.</strong> The K-IP Utilization Fund proposed in the paper can serve as initial seed money. However, the fund should be limited to the initial phase, and ultimately the key is to create a market structure where IP utilization operates as a profit-generating business model.</p><h2>Conclusion: From Global Value Chain Integration to Balanced Partnership</h2><p>The Korean content industry has now fully integrated into the global value chain. This is an irreversible structural change. What we want is clear: maintain global-level production capability while continuing cooperation with global OTTs, build capability to actually utilize secured IP, and restore the domestic ecosystem to recover negotiation power.</p><p>The goal is not to exclude global OTTs but to equip domestic platforms with negotiation power. Just as Demon Slayer first proved success in the Japanese market and leveraged that negotiation power to contract with Netflix on favorable terms, Korea should also create a structure where it first proves success through strong domestic platforms in the first window, then cooperates with global OTTs as equal partners.</p><p>My gratitude to the National Assembly's Media & Communications Forum for organizing this important discussion, and to all participants for the engaging dialogue.</p>"
